Pierre Feedback 5/15

- get real title/description and access point description to show in discovery
- add server information of where you can deploy the data product 
- eventually need to merge data product
- add customization for icon


Create Contract

- create contract modal layout (align better text with screen)
- add contract information even if already provided (user, access point group, data product name)
- overly that reinstates the contract
- pending -> show whats pending in terms of exactly what we are waiting for


- no contract ID should not be shown (or somewhere hidden for devs)
- contract id should be like - contract for data product name 
- show pending tasks (check mark for each task. i.e show clear workflow like etask)
- modal with ability to copy task ID 
-




Task ID
link 
- show see data product, access point and user NAME (department)  + description 
- name should coordinate to department 
- who else can approve 


Subscriptions:
- list of accounts 
- for contracts we should be able infer the list of contracts belong to users
- more human readable 
- I want this access points on this account not on the contract
- get more metadata from accounts
